# My Blog Repository

This repository contains all the blog posts for my personal blog.

## Workflow

- Posts are generated via n8n automation using OpenAI outputs.

## How to add a new post
1. Create a new markdown file in `posts/` folder.
2. Name it as `your-post-title.md`.
3. Add your content in markdown format.

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
